This plugin is for those guys who forget the syntax of different constructs in Verilog.This plugin will add a new menu to GVIM. The sub menus when clicked insert appropriate templates.
This is developed only for GVIM and has key mappings to use with plain VIM. Also its written with windows in mind, so unix user excuse me.
